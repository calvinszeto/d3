# API Overviews

Often, when I start learning a new language or framework, I like to get
an overview of the API, kinda like reading the Table of Contents for a
textbook. For this project, I'll investigate different methods of
visualizing API documentation (and similarly structured data).

## The Data

My data sources for this project will come from my separate scrapy
projects, in particular, scraped API content.
